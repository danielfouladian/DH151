Within 20 m of our front door, there is a 24 hour bakery and at least 4 tavernas. We can certainly suggest some real authentic Greek cuisine at -not to be beaten- prices. This is a living, breathing community, full of artesian workshops and bustling markets. A 10 minute leisurely stroll through the famous flea market along pedestrianised walkways will lead to the magnificent Acropolis of Athens. At night, the area comes alive with a vast choice of bars, tavernas, theatres and yet you will find our accommodation is very quiet, located in a semi-pedestrianised quarter of Psiri."
